# SURGICAL-ROBOT-RAJASTHAN-HACKATHON
Files related to project
INTRODUCTION-
Our project is to develop an internet based robotic system which can be used
for surveillance and surgical purposes through developing a flexible and user
friendly mobile robot controllable from anywhere in world using internet servers.
We will build a robot which can be controlled through hand gestures over server
from any part of the world where internet is available. 


APPLICATIONS-
This has very vast applications.
This robot can be used to perform some operations in nuclear reactor
by a person sitting far away which can be harmful for him if he is
present inside it. This can also be used to perform surgery by a
well known surgeon who is present in some other part of world.


OPERATION-
In this project we are using ADXL345 accelerometer
to recognize the hand gestures, two ESP8266 NodeMCU in
which one will be used to send the data of accelerometer to
server and other to receive it. The data received by NodeMCU
from the server will be used to drive L298N motor driver
which will further drive the DC motor. There are four such DC
motors which will be driven by two motor drivers as each driver
can control two DC motors. 




Problems addressed by our project our-

1. If a well known surgeon is present in some part of the world
away from the patient then our robot can be used to perform surgery
by the surgeon from a far away place using his hand gestures over server.
This problem is very common in village areas where good surgeons are not available.

2. Sometimes it is harmful for a person to carry out operations inside nuclear
reactor which emits harmful radiations. This problem can be solved by our robot
which can perform those operations by a person sitting far away from nuclear
reactor through his hand gestures over server. 

3. While diffusing a bomb there are 50% chances of a
blast and other 50% of getting it diffused. This imposes
a threat to the person diffusing the bomb.
This threat can be removed by our robot which
can be controlled from any part of the world through
hand gestures over server.
